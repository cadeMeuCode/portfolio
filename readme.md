# My portfolio

I'm start to learn html, css and JS, but i'm don't have how to practice, so i'm decide  
to code this portfolio to practice, and to challenge my self.  

### 🚀 What i've learned  

In this project, i'm try to use css animations, flexbox and sidebar. Using JS to animate  
the main content and changing sidebar menu color.

### 📋 Notes

I'm just starting... Some techniques i have implemented while i'm read  
the documentation. The focus for now is if i can implement the tech's in a project.  
Learn how it works, how it doesn't.
